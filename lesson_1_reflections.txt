How did viewing a dif between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced

Well, it is kind of anoying, it is not clear where is the difference, and also
it is not easy to find the line number clearly.
Also I think is a waste of time that you need to check the original file to
 find the exacto position.

 How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

 It is easy to have errors and typos, and also it is common to ruin something that 
 was already working trying to make it work better. In common cases, the problem is very
 easy to solve, and with the history available, is more easy to undo and find the problem
